Server implementation of gRPC Rich Error Model in Node.js.

## Usage

From [grpc.io](https://www.grpc.io/docs/guides/error/#richer-error-model):

> and at least the grpc-web and Node.js libraries have open issues requesting it

See https://github.com/grpc/grpc-node/issues/1338 as well. We just got tired of
